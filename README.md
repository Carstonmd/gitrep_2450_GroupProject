# CS2450 Group Project - UVSim

UVSim is a virtual machine that interprets and runs programs written in the BasicML Language.

UVSim allows line by line entry and then execution of BasicML programs. UVSim also allows the users to save programs to an outputted file, and load programs from a specified file.

To run your program after writing it, simply type `-999999` to execute the program.

To load a program, simply type `load` when first running the program and you will be prompted for a file name to execute.

To save a program, simply type `save` instead of the exit code `-999999` and your file will be outputted to a unique file name.
